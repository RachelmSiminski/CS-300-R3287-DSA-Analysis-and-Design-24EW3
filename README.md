<h3>What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?</h3>
<p>The problem being solved with the projects in this class was design. The entire goal of this class was to learn how to design large-scale programs and algorithms, through the use of flowcharts and/or pseudocode.</p>
<h3>How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.</h3>
<p>I tried to approach this problem by learning more about psuedocode, I attempted tutoring and other activities like watching YouTube videos to help me beef up my knowledge of pseudocoding.</p>
<h3>How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?</h3>
<p>I mostly relied on tutoring to help me, though I am realizing I'm at a point in my schooling where simply hoping into a free tutoring session won't cut it, so i have also started some additional courses in programming to help me get better on the side.</p>
<h3>How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</h3>
<p>I can definitely appreciate the use of pseudocode now. This was the first large-scale project i did, and while its not my best work I am pleased that I was able to get as far as i did. I hope from here my continued practice with pseudocode will only make me better!</p>
<h3>How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h3>
<p>I learned that a lot of code starts with the same basica building blocks, so I was able to resuse a lot of the code in each project. I will continue to improve the adaptability of my code and I want to work on the security in my code!</p>
